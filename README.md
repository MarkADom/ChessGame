# ChessGame
This Project is made for JAVA study and to be added to my personal Library of Implementations.

## Description 

Chess game can be run in the terminal. Played by two players in turns. For that, players have to enter the grid position of the piece they want to move and where they want to move it, the possible moves are marked on the screen as soon as a piece is chosen. Special Chess Rules for Casting, Pawn Promotion, and En Passant have been implemented. Check mate is the goal.
